/**
 * filesQuery.js — the ONE definition of "which files is this admin asking for?"
 *
 * The Super Admin file list used to load whole collections and do everything in
 * the browser: search, filter, sort, paginate, and resolve bulk selections.
 * That is the shape that made the old Admin slow at ~1,000 records and time out
 * at ~1,500. Moving those decisions to the server means the same question —
 * which records match? — is now asked from four places:
 *
 *     the list        (which page of rows to render)
 *     the count       (how many rows in total)
 *     the facets      (which branch / district / stage options to offer)
 *     the bulk action (which records to approve or reject)
 *
 * They MUST agree. The bulk path is why this is a correctness concern and not a
 * tidiness one: with select-all-matching-filter the operator never sees the
 * individual ids, so a filter built even slightly differently there would
 * approve or reject a different set than the screen showed. One builder, used
 * by all four, is what makes that impossible.
 *
 * Read-only: nothing here writes, and nothing here creates an index.
